## Introduction
The blockchain and web3 space have been expanding quickly every day, and yet not many know how to use Web3 products and services. Most people already know or have heard about cryptocurrencies but have only considered it or have learned about them as a speculative trading asset, rather than something with actual utility.
To bridge the gap between Web3 and Web2, and to provide an easy and understandable way for beginners to onboard onto Web3 and discover its amazing use cases, I have taken up the initiative to start a small incentivized learning challenge.

## The Roadmap
### Round 1 (Starting from 05/07/2021 till 19/07/2021)
In this challenge, participants will have to follow a walkthrough that involves them getting onboarded onto the **Polygon Mainnet.**

**Round 1** consists of setting up a Metamask, connecting Metamask to Polygon, getting some free MATIC from [matic.supply](https://matic.supply/) to use as gas, and minting your first NFT using the [Polygon NFT minter](https://mintnft.today/) during Round 1

Users participating in the challenge **must Retweet the original post and tag atleast 2 people, and follow the tutorial walkthrough (given below)**.

Upon completion of the walkthrough, participants must create their own walkthrough/tutorial, as their own content, and share it with their network. If not a walkthrough, participants can share any content which they created exploring their experience navigating the Web3 space (what they felt, what they liked, disliked, difficulties faced, their thoughts, etc.). You are NOT limited on the type of medium you choose to create your content (articles, Twitter threads, videos, etc.) The aim is to broaden your knowledge and let others know what you learned. The more informative (but simplified), creative, and well-thought-out submissions, the better. Only content created during the event will be considered, pre-existing work will be largely ignored.
### **FILL UP THIS FORM FOR ROUND 1 SUBMISSIONS** [https://forms.gle/qSjwEj2kxBorA8Tc9](https://forms.gle/qSjwEj2kxBorA8Tc9)

### ***After the first round, the top submissions will be selected and will be awarded  MATIC, to be used to participate in the 2nd round.***

*All those who have submitted content that seems to have atleast some effort put into it, will also receive MATIC rewards. (Check the Prize Distribution section for more info)

### ROUND 2 (Starting from 02/08/2021 till 26/08/2021)
**Round 2** includes users swapping their newly received MATIC on [**QuickSwap**](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap) or SushiSwap to a stablecoin (DAI, USDC, or USDT), and then depositing it on [**AAVE**](https://aave.com/), to receive interest (*variable*) + MATIC rewards from AAVE.

The 2nd round also requires the participants to create similar content as tutorials, or about their experience and share with their network. Special points for talking about how AAVE works, and even about other DeFi projects.
The more well-thought out, the higher your chances of winning.

#### **The participant who wins 1st place will receive 138 MATIC**
