## Introduction
The blockchain and web3 space have been expanding quickly every day, and yet not many know how to use Web3 products and services. Most people already know or have heard about cryptocurrencies but have only considered it or have learned about them as a speculative trading asset, rather than something with actual utility.
To bridge the gap between Web3 and Web2, and to provide an easy and understandable way for beginners to onboard onto Web3 and discover its amazing use cases, I have taken up the initiative to start a small incentivized learning challenge.
